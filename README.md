# VOCAB-SRPSKI

The latest public version is hosted here: [https://voc-srpski.vercel.app/](https://voc-srpski.vercel.app/).

This is a small project I started to enforce my learning process. The main idea is to self-check how good you can say something in Serbian. The phrases allow one to practice both their vocabulary and grammar.

The tool for that are cards that originally show a phrase in Russian and provide a way to see it in Serbian and mark it as "correct" or "incorrect".

The project is in its early stage and more useful features are on their way. Currently all phrases are kept in the file system and added manualy.

## Technical Information
The project is using Vite.js. The tests are run by Cypress. The styles are written in vanilla CSS and heavily rely on the Modern CSS features and intrinsic design.

The UI is being designed in Figma using components.

## Planned Features
1. Sorting and arranging the cards.
2. A counter for the correct and incorrect answers.
3. Improved UI and the usage of design tokens.
4. Feedback.

## Other ideas
1. A more sustainable way of adding the phrases.
2. More elaborated system of phrases and difficulty levels.
3. Personalisation of the experience of a particular user.
4. Autocheck of typed-in phrases and announcement of phrases in Serbian. Maybe even checking the spoken phrases ðŸ«¢.
5. Personalisation of user's experience. Suggesting phrases.

## Me
Hi, I'm Elena. I'm a fronted developer and my level is middl-ish. In my work I focus on usability and accessibility and a huge part of my process consists of manual testing in screen-readers and writing automatic tests for the UI components. Also, I try to use the Modern CSS features as much as possible and learning those takes a big part of my process as well. A lot has changed since I last worked.

There's a huge gap in my career due to a maternity leave that went south. I've been working on waking up my skills and improving them for about a year with courses and a little bit of practice. This project is one of such efforts.
